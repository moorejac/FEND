# Udacity FEND Project - Memory Game

This project is a simplified version of the classic memory game 'Concentration'.

## How The Game Works
The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

### Each turn:

* The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
* The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
* If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.

The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

### Scoring:

 - Star Rating: As the player performs more moves to complete the game, the star rating decreases.
 - Timer: A timer starts when the first card is clicked and stops after the game is won.
