# Udacity FEND Project - Arcade Game

This project is a simplified version of the classic arcade game 'Frogger'.

## How The Game Works
Use the up, down, left, right arrows to avoid the pesky lady bugs!

### Each turn:
The turn ends and restarts when you successfully advance to the water or you collide with a lady bug.

## HAVE FUN!!
