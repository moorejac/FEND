# Udacity FEND Project - Arcade Game

This project is a simplified version of the classic arcade game 'Frogger'.

## How The Game Works
Use the up, down, left, right arrows to avoid the pesky lady bugs!

### Each turn:
The turn ends and restarts when you successfully advance to the water or you collide with a lady bug.

## Installation
* Download and save the program files to your local machine.
* Browse to the `index.html` file and open in a browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

## HAVE FUN!!
